				The dHealth Network can align the incentives of all
				stakeholders in the healthcare system by making its
				processes more efficient, transparent, and valuable.
				Healthcare is perfectly positioned to be the next area
				of blockchain adoption because it is highly fragmented,
				full of intermediaries, and suffers from a lack of
				transparency and inefficient processes.
				dHealth Network addresses these problems because it is
				not controlled by any single player, can be accessed
				directly by all stakeholders as a peer-to-peer network,
				and functions as a layer of trust. dHealthâ€™s proof-of-stake
				blockchain enables privacy-preserving interactions among
				healthcare stakeholders without the need to build separate
				data-processing infrastructures.
